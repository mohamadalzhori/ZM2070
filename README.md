# Poultry Farm Conditions Monitor

This project is an Arduino-based system designed to monitor and manage temperature and humidity conditions within a poultry farm.

**Over the course of a year in high school, I designed, built, and tested this Arduino-based poultry farm monitor. This project served as my initial intro into the world of embedded systems and programming.**

**Features:**

- Reads temperature and humidity using a Dallas Temperature sensor.
- Controls five fans, a heater and water cooling based on pre-defined temperature thresholds.
- Activates an alarm if the temperature deviates significantly from the set point.
- Allows adjustments to various parameters through an LCD display and button interface.
- Stores settings in EEPROM for persistent data storage.
